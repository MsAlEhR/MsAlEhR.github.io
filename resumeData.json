        "description": "Protein fold recognition plays a crucial role in discovering three-dimensional structure of proteins and protein functions. Several approaches have been employed for the prediction of protein folds. Some of these approaches are based on extracting features from protein sequences and using a strong classifier. Feature extraction techniques generally utilize syntactical-based information, evolutionary-based information and physiochemical-based information to extract features. In recent years, Finding an efficient technique for integrating discriminate features have been received advancing attention. In this study, we integrate Auto-Cross-Covariance (ACC) and Separated dimer (SD) evolutionary feature extraction methods. The results features are scored by Information gain (IG) to define and select several discriminated features. According to three benchmark datasets, DD, RDD and EDD, the results of the support vector machine (SVM) show more than 6% improvement in accuracy on these benchmark datasets."
